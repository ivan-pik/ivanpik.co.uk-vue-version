			"<p>I was hired by BaseKit to join their design team that creates and maintains templates for BaseKit website&nbsp;builder.</p>\r\n  <p>Those templates must work with every widget that BaseKit website builder offers, ranging from a text content, twitter feed, contact form, image slideshow or gallery. There are also blog, store and restaurant menu modules. All those widgets and modules are designed and built responsively and they must cater for various content and for many user&nbsp;settings.</p>\r\n  <p>It was challenging to build website templates which didn’t appear broken or badly designed with some many settings variables and various user content. For example a company name length can vary from a few characters to several words. The logo could be either a small icon, a large banner or set to be hidden. Embedded widgets in the template (typically in the headers and footers) can be hidden or swapped with different type by the user and nothing must break. Also colours and font sizes and font families can be changed by the user. Everything works responsively from a large desktop screen to a small mobile screen<span class=\"thin-space\">–</span>sometimes that’s very tricky, it’s much easier to design and build responsive sites where the content is known beforehand.</p>\r\n  <p>Every template design was discussed in the team and iterated to make sure the visual quality meets the company standards and that the theme fits our typical users and their needs. We also had a strict review process in place within the team even before the template was passed to a QA team. Templates were tested for compatibility with the editor functionality and for various user content. Browser and device testing were conducted either on virtual machines or on a range of real devices that were available to&nbsp;us.</p>\r\n  <p>Templates were built with HTML using TWIG template engine, CSS processed with LESS and many UI state changes were accomplished using jQuery. Source code was managed on&nbsp;GitHub.</p>",

			"<p>TUESDAY Business Network is a part of Internet Info company where I was the sole web designer and front‑end developer. My resources were very limited and we needed a system to create event sites very fast and with minimal effort. Sometimes the event logo and website needed to be designed and launched within only 2&nbsp;days.</p>\r\n  <p>We already had in‑house developed CMS which developers extended to manage events: schedules, speakers, presentation download, registration management&nbsp;etc.</p>\r\n  <p>It would have been time‑consuming to create HTML templates for every event website so I designed a system where the event sites were built entirely via CMS. Each event site was built from predefined pages and components such as an intro, schedule, speakers, gallery, registration form etc.  These predefined pages and components were based on shared HTML templates, custom CSS framework and image&nbsp;assets.</p>\r\n  <p>Some components could be set to display as separate pages or in‑line on the home page. It was therefore possible to build either a small one‑page event site or larger multiple‑page site without having to write a single line of&nbsp;HTML.</p>\r\n  <p>Low‑budget events could rely on default visual theme and could be launched in matter of  hours. Custom design for larger events could be achieved only by providing extra CSS above the base framework<span class=\"thin-space\">–</span>making it possible to create a logo, a simple branding and a web design and to launch the event site within 2<span class=\"thin-space\">–</span>3&nbsp;days. This system has been providing huge savings in time and&nbsp;money.</p>",

			"<p>I was hired by Internet Info where I extended their developer team as a graphic designer, web designer and front‑end developer. I was therefore responsible for every visual work in the company such as print and online ads, logo designs or basic illustrations but the main focus laid on web design and front‑end development.</p>\r\n  <p>When I started in the company I was mostly creating visual layers on top of wireframes that were designed by a company’s business division focused on online consultation. I was involved in our projects from the very beginning of their creation contributing to improve usability and user experience. My growing interest in those areas helped me develop my role so that I became a web designer of all stages of our projects: initial planning, wireframing, user-flows and visual&nbsp;design.</p>\r\n  <p>Unlike print publishing where focus on content has been obvious, online publishing still needed to get there. When I joined the company, our oldest online magazine reached it’s 10th birthday. Although it meant that the publisher had been providing great content for many years and retained a huge user base, our online magazines suffered from archaic web techniques and approaches. Our magazines sites were rather complicated<span class=\"thin-space\">–</span>there were too many features and distractful side content. It was the time when clean and simple pages were considered as something rather wrong, lacking features, there was a tendency that every site had to look “portal”  like. I invested lot of energy and effort into making our magazines simpler and focused on our users/readers. Content was put in the first place, feature bloat was eliminated, layouts were much simplified and readability was greatly improved. I definitely contributed to the company’s shift towards more design-thinking and new features and projects were much better considered and development became more&nbsp;focused.</p>\r\n  <p>For our small dev team to be able to maintain our range of project, efficiency in terms of reusable code and assets was a key to meet company’s plans and to reduce maintenance costs. From my front‑end perspective it meant that HTML code, CSS and image assets for components and pages were shared across projects from one source where possible. Code was managed via Mercurial versioning&nbsp;system.</p>\r\n",
